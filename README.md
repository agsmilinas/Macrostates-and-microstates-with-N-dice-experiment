# Macrostates-and-microstates-with-N-dice-experiment

HTML, CSS and JS application to create the simulation of the Monte Carlo method experiments to find a formula that manages to generalize the macrostates that are generated by throwing a number "N" of dice. The equation that expresses the probability of obtaining the macrostate E from N given. The dice show faces numbered 1 through 6 and all are equally likely. A microstate shows the structure (d0, d1, ..., dN-1), where di is the face of the i-th die.
